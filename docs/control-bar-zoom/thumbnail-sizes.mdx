# Thumbnail sizes

The Grid component allows you to define the size of the thumbnails. This is set via the `imageSizes` prop. The `imageSizes` prop is an array of objects that defines the dimensions of the image.
Thumbnail sizes can be changed by the user through the special control bar at the bottom. Three different thumbnail sizes are available: 1x, 2x, and 3x.

The library comes with a default set of thumbnail sizes.

```jsx
{
  "1X": {
    width: 120,
    height: 100,
  },
  "2X": {
    width: 200,
    height: 180,
  },
  "3X": {
    width: 320,
    height: 280,
  },
};
```

You can override the default set by passing your own array of objects to the `imageSizes` prop.

```jsx
import { Grid } from "react-visual-grid";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Grid images={images} gridLayout="vertical" width={1800} height={1200} imageSizes={{
      "1X": {
        width: 120,
        height: 100,
      },
      "2X": {
        width: 200,
        height: 180,
      },
      "3X": {
        width: 320,
        height: 280,
      },
    }} />
  );
};
```
