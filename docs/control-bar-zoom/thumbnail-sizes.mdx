# Thumbnail sizes

Thumbnail sizes can be specified using the [imageSizes](../props.md#imagesizes) prop, which is an array of objects that defines the dimensions of the images. By default, the library includes a set of thumbnail sizes, namely 1x, 2x, and 3x, which the user can alter using the control bar at the bottom. 

The default set of thumbnail sizes are defined as follows:

```jsx
{
  "1X": {
    width: 120,
    height: 100,
  },
  "2X": {
    width: 200,
    height: 180,
  },
  "3X": {
    width: 320,
    height: 280,
  },
};
```

If you want to use a different set of thumbnail sizes, you can override the default set by passing your own array of objects to the [imageSizes](../props.md#imagesizes) prop. 

Here is an example of how you can pass a new set of thumbnail sizes to the prop:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { Grid } from "react-visual-grid";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Grid 
      images={images} 
      gridLayout="vertical" 
      width={1800} 
      height={1200} 
      imageSizes={{
        "1X": {
          width: 120,
          height: 100,
        },
        "2X": {
          width: 200,
          height: 180,
        },
        "3X": {
          width: 320,
          height: 280,
        },
      }} 
    />
  );
};
```
