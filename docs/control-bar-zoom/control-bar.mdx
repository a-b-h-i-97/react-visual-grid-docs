## Zoom controls

Zoom controls allow you to change the Thumbnail sizes of the images in the Grid. The control depends on the `imageSizes` prop to accurately modify the thumbnail sizes.

## Fullscreen

Fullscreen button allows you to switch between the normal mode and the fullscreen mode. In full screen mode, the component will take up the entire width and height of the screen.

> During the resize operation, the grid is repainted and the recalculation is performed to display the images in the best possible way.

## Dark mode

Dark mode button allows you to switch between the normal mode and the dark mode.

## Go to top or bottom

As the name suggest, Go to top or bottom buttons allow you to quickly jump to the top or bottom of the Grid.
