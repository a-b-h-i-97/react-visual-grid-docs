# Control Bar

Control bar is a special UI control that can be used for controlling the behavior of the Grid. The control bar is displayed at the bottom of the component and it allows you to perform the following actions:

  * Change the Thumbnail sizes
  * Switch between Dark and Normal mode
  * Go Full Screen
  * Quickly jump to the top or bottom of the Grid

## Zoom controls

Zoom controls allow you to change the Thumbnail sizes of the images. The control uses the [imageSizes](../props.md#imagesizes) prop to accurately modify the thumbnail sizes.

## Fullscreen

Fullscreen button allows you to switch between the normal mode and the fullscreen mode. In full screen mode, the component will take up the entire width and height of the screen.

> During the resize operation, the grid is repainted and the recalculation is performed to display the images in the best possible way.

## Dark mode

[Dark mode button](../props.md#enabledarkmode) allows you to switch between the normal mode and the dark mode.

## Go to top or bottom

As the name suggest, Go to top or bottom buttons allow you to quickly jump to the top or bottom of the Grid.
