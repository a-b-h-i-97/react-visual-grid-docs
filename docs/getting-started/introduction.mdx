## What is react-visual-grid?

`react-visual-grid` is a grid library for generating beautiful grids in React. Written in typescript, the library comes with a plethora of features to build powerful and performant image grids.

## Why use react-visual-grid?

- ‚ö°**Performance and flexibility** are the two important principles of `react-visual-grid.` With `react-visual-grid,` you can load thousands of images without hurting the browser's performance. The library comes with an in-built virtualization module to load images fast and efficiently.

- üí° With **virtualization**, the images are loaded only on demand and only when they become visible on the view port.

- üõ†Ô∏è The library is also very flexible and comes with **multiple layouts**. The core `Grid` component supports two layouts: `vertical` and `horizontal.`

- üß± In addition to the `Grid` component, the library also provides a `Masonry` component, using which we can produce beautiful masonry grids.

- üé® If you want to customize the look and feel of the component, this is also possible via the `theming` feature.

- üîç `react-visual-grid` supports 3 unique **zoom modes** with which you can control the size of the thumbnails, and the thumbnail sizes can be controlled via the special control bar.

## Installation

Install the package via `npm` or `yarn`
