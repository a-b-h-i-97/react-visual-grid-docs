# Installation & Usage

## Installation

Install the package via `npm` or `yarn` or `pnpm`

```bash
npm install --save react-visual-grid
```

```bash
yarn add react-visual-grid
```

```bash
pnpm add react-visual-grid
```

## Building a simple Grid

Let's begin by creating a simple image grid with 30 images.
To generate the grid, we will be making use of the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) service for producing random images.

```jsx title="App.js"
import { Grid } from "react-visual-grid";
import "react-visual-grid/dist/react-visual-grid.css";

const images = Array.from({ length: 30 }, (_, index) => ({
  src: `https://picsum.photos/id/${index+1})}/800/600`,
  alt: `Image ${i + 1}`
}));

return (
  <div>
    <Grid
      images={images}
      width={800}
      height={600}
    />
  </div>
);
```

:::info
The component uses the `VERTICAL` layout as the default rendering mode. This can be changed by passing the [gridLayout](../props.md#gridlayout) prop to the Grid component.
:::

:::info
It's mandatory to pass the `width` and `height` props of the Grid, as the library uses these values to render the optimal number of thumbnails.

## Images Array

As we have seen in the example, the images are passed as an array to the Grid component. Each image object comes with a set of properties.

| Name    | Description                      | Type     | Default |
| :------ | :------------------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| src     | URL of the image                 | string   |         |
| alt     | Alt text for the image           | string   |         |
| width   | Width of the image               | number   | 100     |
| height  | Height of the image              | number   | 100     |
| id      | Unique of the image              | string   |         |
| onClick | callback to be executed on click | Function |         |

:::info
  Only the `src` and `alt` properties are mandatory, as the rest of the properties are used for internal purposes and you can safely ignore.
