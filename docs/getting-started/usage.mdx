# Usage

## Building a simple Grid

`react-visual-grid` is built for simplicity, and the API is simple and intuitive.

Let's get started by building a simple image grid with 30 images and using the default layout (vertical). To build the image grids, we will be making use of the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) service for generating images.

```jsx
import { Grid } from "react-visual-grid";
import "react-visual-grid/dist/react-visual-grid.css";

const images = Array.from({ length: 30 }, (_, index) => ({
  src: `https://picsum.photos/id/${index+1})}/800/600`,
  alt: `Image ${i + 1}`
}));

return (
  <div>
    <Grid
      images={images}
      width={800}
      height={600}
    />
  </div>
);
```

:::info
It's mandatory to pass the `width` and `height` props of the Grid, as the library uses these values to render the optimal number of thumbnails.
:::

## Images Array

As we have seen in the example, the images are passed as an array to the Grid component. Each image object comes with a set of properties that need to be set.

Here is the complete list of all the image properties.

:::info
  Only the `src` and `alt` properties are mandatory, as the rest of the properties are used for internal purposes.

| Name    | Description                      | Type     | Default |
| :------ | :------------------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| src     | URL of the image                 | string   |         |
| alt     | Alt text for the image           | string   |         |
| width   | Width of the image               | number   | 100     |
| height  | Height of the image              | number   | 100     |
| id      | Unique of the image              | string   |         |
| onClick | callback to be executed on click | Function |         |
